        sources to carry out complex user interface tasks. Their composability, security, and privacy properties

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The web is a powerful platform that makes it possible to create high-quality content and applications. It would
        be desirable to be able to use it for social media posts, so that they could feature arbitrary content, and to
        be able to compose multiple small web apps together by having them talk to one another. Unfortunately, the
        dominant web security model is a poor fit for such tasks because it makes it way too easy to exfiltrate data, and
        is generally a privacy nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiles change this by offering an environment in which arbitrary web content can be executed, while protecting
        against the egress of data by simply locking down the tile to whatever content is pre-listed in its manifest.
        This makes it possible to embed tiles in social media, chats, LLM interactions, or to compose them with one
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the lack of network interaction is limiting, tile execution contexts can then make tiles powerful all the
        same. For instance, in a chat context all tiles may be able to post and listen on a data channel such that
        each instance can sync with the others.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tile Manifests</h2>
      <p>
        A tile manifest is simply a <a href="masl.html">MASL document</a>, using the Bundle Mode. The manifest
        must have a <code>name</code> and a <code>resources</code> entry, and <code>resources</code> must
        include a <code>/</code> entry for the root.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's all that's needed. How the manifest is obtained depends on the context that the tile is loaded
        from, as detailed in the following sections.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tiles on AT Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        A key use case for tiles is publishing them on the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a> [<a href="#ref-at" class="ref">at</a>].
        Publishing a tile on AT is conceptually simple: every entry in <code>resources</code> must get uploaded
        as a blob to the relevant PDS and then the tile itself must be posted to the account's repository as a
        record containing the manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details of the record and the MASL variant used on AT are specified in <a href="#lexicon">the relevant appendix</a>.
        Please pay particular attention to the details provided there about the manner in which <code>resources</code>
        need to point to blobs in order to operate correctly in an AT context.
      </p>

      <h2>Appendix: Tiles Lexicon</h2>
      <p>
        Note that lexica are not flexible enough to be able to describe the <code>resources</code> map.
        Importantly, whereas regular MASL uses a CID to reference content, when in an AT record it does
        not use the <code>cid</code> type but rather the <code>blob</code> type ([<a href="#ref-masl" class="ref">masl</a>], [<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>], [<a href="#ref-at" class="ref">at</a>]). This is because a PDS
        will not pay particular attention to a CID but will need an uploaded blob to be referenced by
        a blob type in a record.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has important implications with how MASL needs to be used over AT in order to work correctly
        with deployed PDSs. An example <code>resources</code> entry for a root HTML document looks as
        follows:
      </p>
      <pre>{
  …
  "resources": {
    "/": {
      "src": {
        "$type": "blob",
        "ref": { "$link": "bafkreicknles2uzv7sruakcbjtn5pnoc4rqmgkvnavuq4raxexjvcn7osq" },
        "size": 20,
        "mimeType": "application/octet-stream"
      },
      "content-type": "text/html"
    },
    …
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        A few things are worth noting in the above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>$type</code> is required.</li>
        <li>The <code>ref</code> is what's used to link to the CID.</li>
        <li>The <code>size</code> is required by the PDS and it must be correct (in bytes).</li>
        <li>
          The <code>mimeType</code> is required by at least some PDS versions and implementations. Note
          that it doesn't need to match the <em>actual</em> <code>content-type</code> that is provided
          separately. In fact, in some PDS versions it <em>cannot</em> match it in many cases. It is
          recommended, wherever possible, to just use <code>application/octet-stream</code> there.
        </li>
      </ul>
